# ChE2410 Project 2 - Modeling Flow-through Protein Adsorption
Modelling hemoglobin concentration to learn methods of modelling, bifurcation, etc.

Hemoglobin concentration through affinity beads immobilized with haptoglobin (Study Group) or control. Haptoglobin as estimated initial and final concentrations.

System of differential equations describing study group hemoglobin concentration (B), control group hemoglobin concentration (C), and estimated haptoglobin concentration (P). Various parameters were optimized by minimizing error functions in multiple stages to solve the system for relationship with independent variable time.

Model solution and capture estimation. There are still issues with this model that will be investigated.
